These are the 3D Drawings That I Completed Primarily in TinkerCAD in 9th Grade

## Shap

This was my first drawing in onshape, I was originally using Fusion 360 but I wanted to see how good a cloud program like this could work. I decided that I just wanted to throw stuff together because there was not anything complicated that I needed to make. I started with a base zigzag shape and extruded that, then I wanted to see how extruding on an existing body would work so I drew a pi shape. After that everything went off the rails and I added as much as I could while trying new tools. I put lots of holes, a chicken, an egg, a top hat and probably so many other things I am forgetting about. This was not intended to be “good,” it is more just about learning the tools available.  

## Rod Support

This was my first TinkerCAD drawing that incorporated radiuses. At first, they were confusing but eventually I got the hang of it. I had a few issues grouping them together to make it look like one piece but on my newer drawings I have been fixing that issue. I also had trouble centering cylinders until I was shown by a friend a strategy that was a lot easier. The rest of the drawing was very easy to make because it was stuff that I had been doing for a while personally.

## Cassette Stand V2

I thought of this when I began the hobby of cassette collecting. I wanted a way to display my favorites stably while covering as little of the artwork as possible. I originally measured a blank Sony case that I found in my parents’ collection and when I printed that one it only worked with the Sony and was unstable. I later compared it with an official release of DRFSR and found out that the Sony had a different length than most cases. I redesigned it using the standard dimensions and that one ended up working perfectly.
