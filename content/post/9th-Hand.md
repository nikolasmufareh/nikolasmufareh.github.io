## Hand Drawing 19 Redo

We did not learn any new skills during this drawing, but I feel like that this is one of my best drawings. The lines on this one are very bold and easy to read and the arrows are uniform and well-shaped. The extra boldness helps to hide the artifacts from lining up each face of the object. I originally thought that this would be one of my worse drawings because I was using a new pencil that I was not used to, but it ended improving it visually. This drawing was not very difficult but that allowed me to put more time into it and make it one of my best ones.

## Hand Drawing 22

This drawing combined two of the more difficult parts of drawing, which are dimensions and circles. I think that I did a pretty good job on them, the circles are clean and lined up and the dimension/extensions lines look good. I think that I could have done a better job on arrows and a more consistent font size. I feel that I did a better job on the dots for the hidden lines than most drawings. The spacing for the extension lines is clean but I could have done better on the circle dimensions.

## Hand Drawing 18

This drawing is the first one where we learned how to put the dimensions on, I think because of this I spent more time on this and did a better job. The dimensions are drawn neatly with consistent arrows, but the spacing of the extension lines isnâ€™t. Because this drawing is so simple, the measurements are drawn accurately with crisp edges. Because this was my first time drawing dimensions, I spent way too much time centering the text and I did not leave much room to actually write it. I also forgot to extend the extension lines past the dimension lines.
