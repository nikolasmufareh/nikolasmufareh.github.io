These are the Orthographic and Isometric Drawings That I Completed in 10th Grade in AutoCAD

## Holder Base Orthographic

This was the last purely orthographic drawing that I did this year. This one was difficult because there are a lot of weird hidden lines that are very easily to miss when drawing if you are not careful. This one also has an elevated base that made it slightly more difficult to draw. The original drawing that we were using as a guide was also missing the dimensions for the top slab which was a little bit annoying to figure out. One of the dimensions is not in fraction form because it doesn’t translate into any commonly used fraction so that’s why it is different from the rest.

## Saddle Block Section Orthographic

This is the third out of the four section drawings that we completed this year. This was absolutely the most difficult for me to draw. I did not understand any of the hidden lines for the side view drawing, so this took a long time for me to get back to while I completed other drawings. The source drawing we used was missing a lot of dimensions, so we had to do a lot of guesses to get the final one correct. The dividing line for Section A-A was a little tedious to draw. AutoCAD doesn’t have a zigzag line with it’s zigs and zags together densely enough so I had to enter coordinates for each one to get it even.

## Saddle Block Isometric

The saddle block was also the most difficult isometric drawing that I have done so far. This drawing has a lot of strange curves and parts that are hard to figure out at a 30 60 90 angle. I had to restart this isometric many times until it finally clicked in my brain. The parts that tripped me up the most were the edges for the walls in the central rectangle. It was hard to interpret how they should be drawn at this angle but eventually I figured it put and got it looking accurate.
