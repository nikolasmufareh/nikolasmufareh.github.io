Hello!

I'm Niko Mufareh, a Harford Tech CADD student who is looking to get an entry level job position and hopefully in the future, get a job at a mechanical or material engineering company. My hobbies include 3D printing, electronics repair, die-cutting stickers, and learning how to sew and machine embroider.
